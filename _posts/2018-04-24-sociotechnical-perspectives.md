# Sociotechnical Perspectives

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to define the term __"sociotechnical"__, I think it's important to define __"society"__ and __"technology"__ first.

## Society:

![society](../files/Society.jpg "What is a Society?")

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people who share a culture or set of values who depend on one another to satisfy certain physical, social, and psychological needs. These people usually live together, but as the use of the Internet spreads, these groups are no longer bound by physical location.

## Technology:

<img class="resize" src="../files/Technology.png" alt="technology" title="What is Technology?">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An application of knowledge in order to assist in the completion of a goal that would be difficult or impossible with out it. Technology is often thought of as being related to computers, but it can be even more basic than that, such as a wheel, a lever, or a technique.

## Sociotechnical Premise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an article entitled *["The Sociotechnical Perspective"][The Sociotechnical Perspective]*, Sawyer and Jarrahi define the sociotechnical premise as:

> 1) the mutual constitution of people and technologies,
>
>2) the contextual embeddedness of this mutuality, and
>
>3) the importance of collective action.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarize, technology, society, and the people within societies are deeply interwoven, and, because of this, it is important to seek collective action when looking to create change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's no surprise that the Internet has changed society. The Internet is one of the most impactful inventions in all of human history, right up there with fire and toilet paper. But, unlike toilet paper, the Internet is always evolving, and, with the dawn of Web 2.0, the Internet is an inherently social phenomenon. People use it to keep track of friends and relatives, to interact and communicate with people throughout the world, and exchange stories and experiences with complete strangers. As the Internet became part of our society, not only was the Internet shaped by our society, but our society was shaped by the Internet. This is what it means when Sawyer and Jarrahi say that people and technology are a "mutual constitution" and "embedded".

## The Internet is Society

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, before the Internet existed, if you saw a fight happening in the street or in your school, what did you do? You probably either went to call an authority, like a police officer or a teacher, or (if you were particularly brave) wade into the fray yourself. And now? You whip out your phone. You're putting this on Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo, etc., etc., etc. Who cares if the police are called? You're going to get a lot of likes (view, retweets) for this one!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jokes aside, the Internet has increasingly become it's own sort of society, or at least a digital model of our physical society with a whole lot of quirks. The society of the Internet is similar to our physical society, but also very different. People create and share content, they speak their mind, they only communicate with the people they want to, and they feel that they can find like-minded people anywhere in the world. Compared to the boring physical world with its limitations and its social barriers, it's no wonder that more and more people find solace in the Internet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, there is no sphere that I recognize this "alternate society" more than in the political. In the 2016 presidential election, more than any other, we've seen the power and the importance of social media and the Internet in exchanging political idea, debating, spreading information (both false and true), and identifying with a younger demographic than ever. As a conservative who often feels lonely when surrounded by my much more liberal college demographic, the Internet is a place to find people who have similar views and values, to learn and to think critically about ideas that I see traded around me. The freelance journalists, political commentators, and activists that I follow on YouTube, Twitter, and other social media platforms allow me access to people and ideas that I have never been able to experience in real life.

## What It All Means

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's my point? Because of how deeply enmeshed and embedded society and technology are with each other, it is extremely important to consider the social and political implications of new technologies and frameworks *while* they are being developed, and not *after* they are released to the public. A good example of one of the worst possible outcomes is what happened with Google Photos object recognition. Google Photos uses machine learning to categorize photos based on what they contain. Selfies is a common category, and Google Photos is excellent at identifying landmarks and locations. However, scandal arose when a user found that Google Photos [categorized his photos of himself and his friend (both black people) as "Gorillas".][Google Photos Gorillas] This was an appalling mistake, but it serves as an example of what can happen when a technology is put into use without consideration of the social and political impact that it can have.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer can developers develop without consideration of the social spheres and dichotomies of the world today. As the above example shows, before a technology is released, it needs to be thoroughly tested and analyzed to attempt to determine the possible effect, both postitive and negative, that it could have on the world.
