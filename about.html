  <h1>About Me</h1>
</div><!-- /.blurb -->
<p> I'm Jonathan Law and I'm a third year Data Science student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. I recently changed my major from Computer Science to Data Science, so my journey into the field is only just beginning! I made this site for several reasons, but mostly I made it to showcase the data science projects I work on as I seek to broaden my skillset.</p>
