<img src='/files/ProfilePicture_edited.jpg' class="profile-picture" align='left' alt='Profile Picture' width="175" height="210"><p> I'm Jonathan Law and I'm a third year Data Science student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. I recently changed my major from Computer Science to Data Science, so my journey into the field is only just beginning! I made this site for several reasons, but mostly I made it to showcase the data science projects I work on as I seek to broaden my skillset.</p>
<p> Other than data science, my professional interests include machine learning, big data, parallel computing, and NLP. My other interests include longboarding, music and music composition, weightlifting, reading, writing, and movie-watching. <p> 
<p> Other than my data science projects, I'll be using this site to: </p>
<ul>
	<li> Blog posts, on both my professional and personal interests </li>
	<li> Book Reviews </li>
	<li> Movie Reviews </li>
	<li> Professional Development </li>
</ul>
<p> If you're interested in my work, check out my Projects page. If you're looking for posts about my personal interests or my opinions on books or movies, check out my Blog! Finally, if you're looking to hire me, check out my Resume! </p>
<p><strong>Have a good one!</strong></p>
<p>-Jonathan</p>
