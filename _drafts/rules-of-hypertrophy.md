### How do I...? What should I...?
Reddit and bodybuilding forums are filled with questions from beginners agonizing over their weightlifting program. Between newbie questions, people getting bored or not seeing results, or people like myself who want as much information as possible before setting out, in order to get the best possible results.

There's nothing wrong with any of these questions. They're perfectly natural. However, there are so many opinions, options, and programs out there (not to mention all the people selling programs, methods, and supplements) that many are easily confused. Just a simple search on YouTube can give you dozens or hundreds of complicated, confusing, and often even contradictory videos.

Although a lot of these in depth videos and articles can be useful to the intermediate or experienced lifter, many do not have the background knowledge or experience in order to *understand*, let alone *implement* the techniques and concepts they present.

What may be most useful, to both the beginner and a more experienced lifter, would be a set of easy, boiled-down rules that they can apply almost immediately. Brad Schoenfeld's paper, "[**The Mechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy and Their Application to Resistance Training**](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2010/10000/The_Mechanisms_of_Muscle_Hypertrophy_and_Their.40.aspx)", lays out those rules which we will be examining today.

### A Note On Goals
People start lifting for many different reasons, but the two main goals of someone lifting weights are to:

- Build strength, or
- Build muscle/look better aesthetically

These goals are often complementary, but much of the confusion that lifters experience comes from the fact that most programs prioritize one or the other. As Schoenfeld mentions, both types of programs induce hypertrophy, but bodybuilders, who follow a hypertrophy-focused program, are much better at building muscle size, while powerlifters, who focus on raw strength, usually do not have the same amount of visible muscle mass as a bodybuilder.

### The Study
#### The Author
Brad Schoenfeld is often known as the "[Hypertrophy Specialist](https://www.t-nation.com/training/hypertrophy-specialist)" or the "[King of Hypertrophy](www.eattoperform.com/2016/02/24/11915/)". From his bio on his site, "[Look Great Naked](http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/)":
> Brad Schoenfeld, Ph.D, C.S.C.S., is an internationally renowned fitness expert and widely regarded as one of the leading authorities on body composition training (muscle development and fat loss). He is a lifetime drug-free bodybuilder, and has won numerous natural bodybuilding titles.

It's safe to say that Brad knows what he's talking about. He's been featured in Men's Health, The New York Times, on ABC, CBS, NBC, and Bodybuilding.com. The paper we'll be looking at today is often known as the Bible of Hypertrophy.
