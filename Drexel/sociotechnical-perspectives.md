&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to define the term __"sociotechnical"__, I think it's important to define __"society"__ and __"technology"__ first.

### Society:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people who share a culture or set of values who depend on one another to satisfy certain physical, social, and psychological needs. These people usually live together, but as the use of the Internet spreads, these groups are no longer bound by physical location.

### Technology:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An application of knowledge in order to assist in the completion of a goal that would be difficult or impossible with out it. Technology is often thought of as being related to computers, but it can be even more basic than that, such as a wheel, a lever, or a technique.
