# Sociotechnical Perspectives

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to define the term __"sociotechnical"__, I think it's important to define __"society"__ and __"technology"__ first.

## Society:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people who share a culture or set of values who depend on one another to satisfy certain physical, social, and psychological needs. These people usually live together, but as the use of the Internet spreads, these groups are no longer bound by physical location.

## Technology:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An application of knowledge in order to assist in the completion of a goal that would be difficult or impossible with out it. Technology is often thought of as being related to computers, but it can be even more basic than that, such as a wheel, a lever, or a technique.

## Sociotechnical Premise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an article entitled *["The Sociotechnical Perspective"](The Sociotechnical Perspective)*, Sawyer and Jarrahi define the sociotechnical premise as:

> 1) the mutual constitution of people and technologies,
>
>2) the contextual embeddedness of this mutuality, and
>
>3) the importance of collective action.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarize, technology, society, and the people within societies are deeply interwoven, and, because of this, it is important to seek collective action when looking to create change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's no surprise that the Internet has changed society. The Internet is one of the most impactful inventions in all of human history, right up there with fire and toilet paper. But, unlike toilet paper, the Internet is always evolving, and, with the dawn of Web 2.0, the Internet is an inherently social phenomenon. People use it to keep track of friends and relatives, to interact and communicate with people throughout the world, and exchange stories and experiences with complete strangers. As the Internet became part of our society, not only was the Internet shaped by our society, but our society was shaped by the Internet. This is what it means when Sawyer and Jarrahi say that people and technology are a "mutual constitution" and "embedded".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, before the Internet existed, if you saw a fight happening in the street or in your school, what did you do? You probably either went to call an authority, like a police officer or a teacher, or (if you were particularly brave) wade into the fray yourself. And now? You whip out your phone. You're putting this on Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo, etc., etc., etc. Who cares if the police are called? You're going to get a lot of likes (view, retweets) for this one!
